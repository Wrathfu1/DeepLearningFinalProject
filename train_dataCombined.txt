Joe Shaye: Secret Service? What are you talking about? Keep your hands in the air.
Frank: You think the FBI are the only ones tracking this guy. We've been following a paper trail for months, almost had him in New York. Would you mind taking that gun out of my face, it makes me nervous.
Joe Shaye: Let me see some identification.
Frank: Here. Take my whole wallet. Frank throws his wallet to Joe, who catches it with his free hand, but doesn't open it. FRANK (CONT'D) You want my gun, too? Come over here and take my gun!

Joe Shaye: Not really. I made a mistake.
Special Agent Wilkes: Forget about it. There are hundreds of John Doe's out there.
Joe Shaye: Yeah, but I'm gonna get this one. The worst thi a paperhanger can do is show is I saw him, I heard his voice -- r s nothing for him
Spect-Aloa T Wilkes: Just be careful, J u've got 12- years in, nobody bo r u down on the first floor. You ally wrote the book on bank d, and that's good enough to make you F-4 { some day. There's no reason to put yourself in this type of position.
Joe Shaye: what position is that?

Frank: Okay. I'm at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan. Suite 3113. Joe starts to write this down, then suddenly stops himself.
Joe Shaye: You think you're gonna get me again, don't you? You'd love for me to send twenty agents out on Christmas Eve to barge into that hotel, break down doors so you can make a fool out of me again?
Frank: Joe, I'm sorry if I made a fool out of you.
J Shays: Goddamn it, o t you feel sorry for me. The tru h knew it was you. Maybe I didn 1 {he trigger, but I knew.

Frank: I have to go. I'm catching a flight in two hours. Merry Christmas, Joe.
Joe Shaye: You didn't call to apologize, did you John Doe?

Special Agent Wilkes: Wait a second, Joe. Those slips don't even have his name on them.
Joe Shaye: The bank scanners read the micker ink before they read pen ink. So even though those deposit slips are filled out correctly, each person who made a deposit that day was actually putting money into his account.
Special Agent Wilkes: How much did he get?
Joe Shaye: Forty-six thousand, four hundred and' twelve dollars. It was the second largest bank robbery in the history of Las Vegas. 98 INT. - PAN AM BUILDING COMMISSARY. - DAY 98 Paul Mulligan sits across from Frank eating lunch. Frank is dressed in school clothes and holding a notebook.

Joe Shaye: The Skywayman. Holy shit, a perfect match.
Amdursky: They describe The Skywayman as a thirty-year-old -- dark hair --six- feet -- same fucking guy!
Joe Shaye: It doesn't make any sense. A thirty- year-old has to register for the draft, which means his prints have to be here.
Fox: Maybe there's a reason he didn't register. He could have a wooden leg for all we know. Maybe he was born in Peru and he's not an American
Joe Shaye: Maybe he's not thirty.

Brenda: No, I'm not.
Frank: I'll bet if I asked you to check the status of my friend, Lance Applebaum, you could do that in a second. He hurt his foot tonight. Brenda grabs a chart, starts to read it out loud.
Brenda: Mr. Applebaum fractured his ankle. Doctor Ashland is treating him in exam seven.
Frank: See that. No problem. Brenda smiles, covering her mouth.
Brenda: This is the emergency chart. See the blue star, that means the patient has been diagnosed. After he's treated, we put a red circle here.

Mcclane: How 'bout some Christmas music?
Argyle: That is Christmas music. And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.  McClane gives up, looks out the window. 9       HIS P.O.V.                                             9 Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats, Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token "Happy Chanukahs"...it is clear that Christmas L.A. style has its own unique style. 10-     OUT                                             OUT   10- 11                                                            11 11-A    THE LIMO - CENTURY CITY                               11-A TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit, impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out, which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle. 12      EXT. NAKATOMI BUILDING - NIGHT                        12 Argyle climbs out of the limo and stops by the trunk.
Argyle: So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
Mcclane: It's corny, but I could live with it.
Argyle: What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
Mcclane: I'll find someplace. He looks up at the highrise lit by huge spotlights, then back at Argyle who's made no attempt to open the trunk.
Argyle: Tell you what.  I'll pull into the parking garage and wait.  You score with your wife give me a call on the car phone and I'll leave your bags inside at the desk.  You strike out... I'll get you to a hotel. He hands McClane a business card with the number on it.
Argyle: Just remember that when you sign for the tip. (pointing to the building) They're paying for it, so don't be shy. McClane grins, heads inside. 13      INT. NAKATOMI LOBBY - NIGHT                           13 Beautiful and -- on first glance -- deserted.  Finally a SOUND in the sterile lobby reveals the presence of a SECURITY GUARD hidden until now behind a massive desk. McClane goes there, signs in.
Mcclane: Holly McClane? The Guard points to a prominent touch screen computer console.
Guard: Just type it in there. McClane is confused for a moment, then he moves to the screen. He gives the Guard a look...the Guard raises his eyebrows as if to say give it a try. 13-A    SCREEN - CLOSER                                       13-A McClane types, "McClane, Holly".  Pause.  The screen replies,
No Such Employee Listed.: 13-B    MCCLANE                                               13-B Frowns...thinks.  Simultaneously inspired and suspicious, he types again. 13-C    THE SCREEN                                            13-C McClane types, GENNERO, HOLLY.  This time the screen CHANGES, shows an elevation of the building and then a floor plan of the 30th floor with Holly's office BLINKING.                      * 13-D    BACK TO SCENE                                         13-D
Mcclane: Cute toy.
Guard: Yeah.  When you have to take a leak it'll help you find your zipper.
Mcclane: Thirtieth floor...                                  *
Mcclane: Lots of hardware... The guard shrugs.  McClane gets in the elevator. 14      INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT                                  14 McClane hits "30" and REACTS to the hyper-powered SPEED with which he rises.  He rotates his head, getting out the travel cricks. As he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous THUMPING, THROBBING NOISE.  McClane stops and listens before he realizes -- it's the party.  As the doors open the noise ATTACKS us. 15      30TH FLOOR - SAME                                      15 McClane moves around the edge of the party, gradually spiraling inward.  He grabs a glass of Mimosa champagne punch from a passing tray, sips...scowls.  Spotting open beers in an ice bucket, he tosses the punch into a potted plant, even burying the plastic glass.  Sipping the beer, he moves through the dense party.  People he doesn't know throw streamers over him. A WOMAN kisses him.  He grins.  A MAN kisses him.
Mcclane: (to himself, shaking his head) California... Finally he queries a DANCING WOMAN.  The MUSIC drowns out their words but she nods, points off in some generic direction. McClane heads that way, cuts around a Christmas tree, loses his bearings.  He sees: 15-A    TAKAGI                                                 15-A who has an air of authority.  McClane goes up to him.
Mcclane: Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Takagi: Holly Gennero?
Mcclane: Yeah.  How'd you know?
Takagi: I've spent half my life on airplanes,               * I can recognize someone who just got off one.
Mcclane: So I've heard. Takagi smiles, leads the way.  As they approach Holly's office door, McClane notices the name there is -- again -- "Gennero".
Takagi: Holly went to the Vault room to FAX some documents...she should be back any... 16      HOLLY'S OFFICE                                         16 Ellis is behind the desk.  He's SNIFFLING and just as they come in he SWEEPS the back of the slick desktop with his hand. Both McClane and Takagi catch on...but Takagi tries to hide his awareness.
Ellis: Ah...hi...I just had to make a quick call, and this was the nearest phone...
Takagi: (eager to change the subject, to McClane) Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
Takagi: Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks. McClane laughs.  He likes this guy.
Ellis: Actually, it's kind of a double celebration.        * We closed a pretty big deal today and a lot of it was due to Holly. The door OPENS.  Holly comes inside.
Holly: All set, Joe.  The contracts went over the wire, and --
Mcclane: Yeah.  I remember our first date.
Ellis: Show him the watch. As she hesitates:
Ellis: Go on, show him.  What're you, embarrassed?
Mcclane: Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.
Mcclane: (surprised, actually feeling tension decline) Son-of-a-bitch.  It works. Holly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket, tie shirt, etc.  Begin to wash up in the private bath.
Holly: What are you doing?
Mcclane: It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Holly: That's okay...
Holly: So, where are you staying?  This                    * all happened so fast I didn't even ask you on the phone. McClane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway.
Mcclane: Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
Holly: Oh...Where does he live?
Mcclane: Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Holly: Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house. McClane fixes her with a look.
Mcclane: They would, huh?
Holly: ...I've missed you.                                 *
Mcclane: Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Mcclane: Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Holly: Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
Mcclane: No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Holly: My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Mcclane: Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Holly: You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.
Ginny: Miz Gennero?  Mr. Takagi is looking for you...he wants you to say something to the troops...
Holly: Thanks, Ginny.  I'll be a second. Oh, this is --
Holly: I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
Mcclane: Don't I always? She's gone.  Immediately, he slaps his forehead, contrite.
Theo: We're in. 25      ON THE SCREEN                                          25 the driver nods at the security camera as several men climb out of the rear of the van and begin unloading wooden crates by the service elevator. 26      INT. ELLIS' OFFICE - NIGHT                             26 McClane looks at all the lavishness around him and picks up a phone by the toilet.  He opens his wallet and takes out the phone number Argyle have him.  A photo of his children stops him. It's of Holly, the two children and himself in happier days: Six months ago, before Nakatomi came calling to Holly's door. McClane flips it over.  On the back in crude but painstaking hand of a five-year-old it says:  WE MISS YOU, DADDY.  LOVE LUCY (and in more primitive letters) JOHN. McClane returns the photo to his wallet, dials the number. 26      INT. BUILDING OPERATIONS CONTROL ROOM                  26 Theo enters the small control room and comfortably sits behind a maintenance keyboard.  Whistling a vaguely familiar tune, he TYPES in some commands and locks down the passenger elevators up to the 30th floor.  Then with several more computer commands, systematically causes: 27      THE HEAVY STEEL GATES TO THE PARKING GARAGE CLOSE      27 28      THE ESCALATORS TO THE GARAGE COME TO A STOP            28 29      OUT                                             OUT    29 30      CONTROL ROOM - SAME                                    30 Theo finishes typing and disconnects the keyboard and pulls out the wires from beneath the panel. 31      INT.

Theo steps to the door of the control room and tosses Hans a
Computer Card.: Hans goes to the front door, waves the card over a magnetic plate.  An LED BLINKS and the door LOCKS with a THUD. Hans looks out at the street.  Appropriately enough, "not a creature is stirring."  Century City is quiet. 32-     OUT                                             OUT    32- 35                                                             35 35-A    LOBBY - QUICK CUTS                                     35-A An elevator opens REVEALING TEN MORE MEN, all armed with Kalashnikov machine guns are carrying canvas kit bags.  One of them, EDDIE, a rugged American in his twenties, goes to the dead guard and immediately begins changing into his cloths. Meanwhile: A)  Karl takes a tool case from the elevator and joins his brother TONY, first playfully grabbing him.  They head for the basement stairwell; B)  Theo leaves the control room and nods to Hans. C)  Eddie finished adjusting buttons and snaps on his pilfered uniform, takes his position behind the front desk. 36      HANS                                                   36 looks at his watch and seems pleased.  He steps into the service elevator with the others and presses the button for the 30th floor.  The entire sequence has taken maybe sixty seconds. 37      INT. ELLIS' BATHROOM - 30th FLOOR - SAME               37 McClane is still barefoot, his pant legs now rolled up above his ankles.  He stretches his toes again.  Damn, it works.  He lights up a new Marlboro, dials a number on the (bathroom) phone. 38      INT. BUILDING BASEMENT - PHONE ROOM                    38 A large sign says:  PACIFIC BELL EMPLOYEES ONLY.  Inside Tony stands in front of an intimidating matrix of phone lines -- but what he has in mind won't require a doctorate in Electrical Engineering.  Karl comes over, gives his an elder brother's punch on the arm, points out what to do.  Together they focus on four CPV plastic conduits which run out of the main panel over their heads.  Tony nods.  Opens a case REVEALING a compact electric chainsaw. 39      INT. ELLIS' BATHROOM - RESUME                          39
Argyle: Hey, John, what's the word on you and your lady?

Mcclane: What do you want, 'All My Children'? We're making progress.  After I get my foot out of my mouth, we'll really be cooking, and then I can -- He stops and gently taps the phone cradle.  No dial tone. 43      INT. LIMO                                             43 Argyle looks at the phone.
Argyle: What?...Mr. Mac, you there? He turns down the music but there is on one on the line.
Mcclane: Shit... He looks out the window at: 51-A    NEIGHBORING BUILDING - MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                51-A A high-rise apartment building a half-block away sparkles with lights.  McClane stares at a PRETTY GIRL in her bedroom.  She's wearing drop dead underwear right out of the Victoria's Secret catalog.  As we watch, she flops down on her bed, and with one long leg in the air, effortlessly dials a call on her high-tech phone.  It seems so easy. 51-B    BACK TO SCENE                                          51-B Frustrated, he watches this, knits his brow.
Mcclane: Think... 52      INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                 52 The employees have been herded to the center of the room where the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering. 52-A    HOLLY                                                  52-A She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward. Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her mettle. 52-B    WIDER                                                  52-B As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly. He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her hand "reassuringly." Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks his own scribblings like a dais speaker.
Hans: Nice suit.  John Philips...London? Takagi stares at him, speechless.
Hans: It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
Hans: I believe you.
Hans: Mr. Takagi, we could discuss industrialization of men's fashions all day, but I'm afraid my associate, Mr. Theo, has some questions for you. Sort of fill-in-the blanks questions actually...
Jump Cut: 64      A COMPUTER SCREEN SPITS OUT:                          64
Board Workstation.: ENTER CENTRAL COMPUTER CODE KEY _ _ _ _. 65      THEO                                                  65 sits fingers poised over the keyboard.  Hans sits opposite. Takagi stands like the accused at the foot of the table, has just read the screen, blurts:
Takagi: I don't have that code...!
Hans: SIT DOWN! Takagi complies.  Hans is abruptly compassionate and quiet.
Hans: Mr. Takagi...I'm not interested in your computer.
Hans: Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
Takagi: You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Takagi: It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open! Hans lifts the gun.
Hans: Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
Karl: It's not over... Hans gives them both a look like an annoyed schoolmaster, turns back to Takagi.
Hans: This is too nice a suit to ruin, Mr. Takagi.  I'm going to count to three.  There will not be a four.  Give me the code. He cocks the gun:
Takagi: I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
Hans: Okay. BANG!!  He pulls the trigger: 66      OUT IN THE MUSEUM - MCCLANE                           66      * reacts as if shot. A66-A   HIS P.O.V.

Hans springs to his feet:
Hans: We do it the hard way!  Tony, see if you can dispose of that. (the body) Karl, you'd better check Heinrich's work up on the machine floor. Karl, in the midst of handing Theo a fifty dollar bill, nods. 67      OUTSIDE - MCCLANE                                     67 stunned, sees Hans move and tries to retreat.  But his gun bumps the underside of the table: 68      INSIDE - HANS                                         68 hears it.  Karl is the first to move: 69      KARL                                                  69 springs through the door, finds nothing.  He checks two adjoining rooms, the first is deserted.  The second...is locked. 70      KARL                                                  70 returns to Hans.
Karl: Nothing...
Mcclane: Argyle.  Tell me you heard the shot. Tell me you heard the shot and you're calling the police right now...
Argyle: I'm working, honey.  Working hard. 'Course I'll be by later to pick you up, have I ever lies to you?  My boss? He thinks I'm cruising to Palm Springs... 72-A    MACHINE LEVEL - TIGHT ON CEILING                      72-A Heinrich PRESSES something into a niche here, scrambles like a monkey to a new position.  Helped by one of his men, he JUMPS down, moves to another area, climbs up again, removing something from his shoulder bag. 73      VAULT ROOM - 31ST FLOOR                               73 Hans and Theo enter the safe room.  The huge corporate safe looms in front of them.  Theo places three kit bags onto a table and rolls up his sleeves.  He swivels a computer console into handy reach, sits down.
Hans: How long?
Theo: Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
Hans: If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us. Theo grins, begins typing. 73-A    HIS SCREEN                                            73-A He types BEGIN ALGORITHM CODE PROGRAM.

Mcclane: Why the fuck didn't you stop him?
Mcclane: C'mon, baby...come to Papa.  I'm gonna kiss your Goddamn dalmatian. 78      INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME                78 He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony.
Hans: (calmly, to Eddie on CB) Call 911, give them the name and badge number on your uniform and cancel the alarm...then disable the system. (looks across at Tony, presses talk button again) Eddie?  What floor did the alarm go off? 78-A    MACHINE FLOOR                                         78-A They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and       * Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work. 79      UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                               79 McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto Avenue of the Stars. Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and turn down separate side streets, heading for home.
Tony: The fire has been called off, my friend.  No one is coming to help you.  You might as well come out and join the others. (fingers the trigger of his machine gun) I promise not to hurt you. Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near the cubicles. Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle. 83      TONY'S P.O.V.                                         83 A radial arm saw spins noisily. 84      TONY                                                  84 grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane, steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel against Tony's temple.
Mcclane: Freeze, Police...don't move or name your beneficiary. Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him calmly.
Tony: You won't hurt me.
Mcclane: Yeah?  Why not?
Mcclane: Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling me the same thing. McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.
Mcclane: Let's go. Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends his pistol into the hall. Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk. He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash into: 85      STAIRWELL LANDING                                     85 then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below. For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly to the side. For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly, methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND coming from somewhere attracts his attention. He rises, moves cautiously to the source. 85-A    NEW ANGLE                                             85-A It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.
Mcclane: A million terrorists in the world and I kill the one with feet smaller than my sister. He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair. He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to: 86-A    A DESK                                                86-A Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper. Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.  He smiles to himself. 86-B    IN THE ELEVATOR - UNFINISHED FLOOR                    86-B TIGHT ON McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD) CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and 30th floors. We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket. The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with his fingers -- stopping the car between floors. Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting the car in motion again. 86-C    HOSTAGE FLOOR                                         86-C The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor. Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.
Hans: I wanted this to be professional, efficient, adult, cooperative.  Not a lot to ask.  Alas, your Mr. Takagi did not see it that way...
Fritz: Perhaps a security guard we overlooked...? Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over.
Hans: Franco, you and Fritz take the body upstairs and out of sight.  I don't want the hostages to think too much. 88      INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CAR ROOF - ON MCCLANE - SAME    88 On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close. The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy, grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up. 89      MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                      89 A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft. 90      MCCLANE                                               90 pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane pushes it open and looks in. 91      MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                      91 Total darkness. 92      MCCLANE                                               92 takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel. Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.
Mcclane: Jesus... He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door McClane enters a darkened: 93      PUMP ROOM                                             93 damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the door and looks out. 94      MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                      94 The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport above him is higher. 95      30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME    95 WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's    * barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling hands on the man's shoulder.
Hans: I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
Ellis: What's happening?
Holly: They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
Ellis: The police...?
Ellis: John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
Holly: How about his job?
Ellis: His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
Mcclane: Mayday, Mayday!  Anyone!  Terrorists have seized and Nakatomi building and are holding 30 or more hostages! I say again -- 97      OUT                                             OUT   97 98      INT. HANS' OFFICE - SAME                              98 Hans, Karl, Fritz and France hear the clear signal over Hans'
Mcclane'S Voice: -- unknown number of terrorists, six or more, armed with automatic weapons at Nakatomi, Century City... Somebody answer me, Goddamnit! Karl looks almost...satisfied.
Hans: The roof.  It's the best place to transmit. They move. 99      INT. LOS ANGLES EMERGENCY DISPATCH CENTER - SAME      99 A SUPERVISOR weaves her way back from the break room toward a DISPATCHER who is monitoring the call.
Dispatcher: It's the same address as that fire signal --                                            *
Mcclane'S Voice: No fucking shit, lady!  Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza? 100     OUT                                             OUT  100 101     INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON KARL - SAME               101 with Franco and Fritz.
Karl: No one kills him but me. It's an order and the look he gives the other two backs it up. Karl checks his magazine, SLAPS it into his rifle as the elevator opens to the roof. 102     EXT. UPPER ROOF                                      102 McClane moves around the roof, circling the helipad, making sure he has a good enough view to avoid being ambushed.  He can't see in all directions at once but he's doing the best he can.
Mcclane: They've already killed one hostage, and they're fortifying their positions while we're bullshitting!  Now, send police backup ASAP!
Supervisor'S Voice: Sir, I've already told you, this is a reserved channel.  If this is an emergency call, dial 911 on your telephone.  Otherwise I will report you to the police --
Clerk: Thought you guys just ate donuts.
Powell: They're for my wife.  She's pregnant. If I knew she was gonna eat a dozen at a shot, I woulda bought stock in the company. The Clerk nods and puts them in a bag.  As Powell pays, suddenly his BELT RADIO crackles to life. DISPATCHER'S VOICE/RADIO Dispatch to One Adam Ten, over. Powell grabs the radio, speaks into it.
Powell: One Adam Ten, go ahead. DISPATCHER'S VOICE/RADIO Investigate a code two at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.
Dispatch Voice: One Adam Ten, do you copy? Powell is already moving to the car.  He tosses in the twinkies, hops behind the wheel.
Powell: (into police radio) Roger, dispatch.  I'm on the way. And he BURNS RUBBER leaving the store:
Hans' Voice: Karl?  Franco?  Did you catch him?
Franco: No, but he's in the elevator shaft.
Hans' Voice: Prefect.  The elevators are locked off.              * He can't escape.  Just shut him in and return to base.
Karl: Hans, he killed by brother --
Mcclane: Whew...for a moment there I was worried. He turns out his lighter, and starts crawling. 130-    OUT                                             OUT   130- 133                                                           133- 133-A   INT. MACHINE FLOOR                                    133-A The three terrorists rush down from the roof in hot pursuit, Karl leading the way through the door.  Karl points quickly to the left and right where there are a series of rooms.  The others checks these while Karl approaches the CAMERA, trigger finger ITCHING.  Almost immediately, the others return.
Franco: Nothing. Karl hesitates a moment, fighting his instincts before finally turning to go.  Suddenly the duct McClane is in GROANS slightly under his weight.  Karl stops and looks up at the matrix of aluminum duct work, trying to single out the source of the sound.  He steps back into the room and raises his rifle. Holding it upright he presses the barrel up into the belly of McClane's air duct, feeling for weight -- the weight of a body. 137     INSIDE THE AIR DUCT                                   137 McClane sees the indention of the barrel pressing into the aluminum fifteen feet away.  There is a pause and another three feet closer.  He can hear Karl's footsteps on the concrete -- moving slowly below the duct. 138     ON KARL                                               138 His eyes are fixed above him on the air duct.  He presses the barrel up again.  Still nothing. 139     ON MCCLANE                                            139 Silently he moves his hand, slowly draws his Beretta.  The next indention presses up six feet away.  McClane points his gun downward and waits. 140     KARL                                                  140 stops directly below him.  The barrel starts up and just touches the duct under McClane when Franco returns to the door and calls:
Franco: Karl!  Police!  Come on. Karl hesitates then lowers his gun and leaves. 141     CLOSE - MCCLANE                                       141 He hears the door close and lowers his head. 141-A   INT. 33RD FLOOR - SAFE ROOM                           141-A The large LED WINDOW in the front of the safe BEEPS and letters creep by:  ACCESS CODE ACCEPTED.  We HEAR a CLUNK. CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Theo, who grins.  Now his computer screen reads, LOCK #1 DISABLED.  DO YOU WISH TO PROCEED? Theo puts goggles on his eyes, holds out his hands towards Kristoff like a doctor requesting a scalpel.  Kristoff gives him a GIANT DRILL.
Theo: You bet your ass I'm gonna proceed. He turns on the drill: 142     OUT                                             OUT   142 143     EXT. CENTURY CITY - AVENUE OF THE STARS - NIGHT       143 The street is empty, quiet.  A lone police black-and-white pulls out of the shadows of a side street and begins a slow cruise toward the Nakatomi building. 144     ON POWELL                                             144 Driving, alone.  He starts up at the tower.  It seems calm, its glowing lights matching the warmth of the holiday decorations on the streets.  Powell slows to a stop and scans the premises.  In the lobby we SEE Eddie, sitting behind the desk.  Powell reports to his radio.
Powell: Guard inside.  No signs of disturbance ...I'm going up for a closer look. He pulls in and parks in the front. 145     INT. MACHINE ROOM - SAME                              145 McClane punches out a ceiling vent and drops down into the machine room.  For a moment he stands, listening for sounds of movement.  The floor is quiet.  He goes to the stairwell. 146     EXT. ROOF - SAME                                      146 The edge of the roof.  Suddenly a tall terrorist, James, moves along the wall and looks over at Powell's car. 147     INT. 3RD FLOOR - SAME                                 147 The elevator doors open on Karl, Franco and Fritz.  They      * step out onto the darkened floor.  We SEE large number "3" painted on the doors of this floor. They move quickly toward the windows on the Avenue of the Stars side where a terrorist, ALEXANDER, with a BAR rifle has set up a machine gun nest under a half-opened window.  Directly below him we SEE Powell's car. Alexander PANS the police car with his weapon, finger on the trigger.  This is clearly a man hungry for action. 148     30TH FLOOR (HANS' OFFICE) - SAME                      148 Hans watches from above.  He raises his CB.
Hans' Voice: Let him in. Eddie is a little startled, but he moves quickly. 149-A   ALEXANDER                                             149-A also hears this, and his eager expression fades.  But orders are orders. 150     EXT. FRONT DOOR OF NAKATOMI - SAME                    150 Powell tries the front doors.  Locked.  Eddie comes hustling across and unlocks the door with the magnetic card.
Eddie: Evening, officer.  What's up? Powell steps in and looks around.  Bland HOLIDAY MUZAK filters from Speakers here.   (LET IT SNOW)                           *
Powell: We got an emergency call that there was a problem here. 151     INT. 34TH FLOOR - BOARD ROOM - SAME                   151     * McClane makes his way to the Avenue of the Stars side of the building, enters the board room where Takagi was shot. McClane goes to the windows and looks down at the street. 152     HIS P.O.V.                                            152 Powell's car.
Mcclane: All right! McClane waits, expectant.  Five seconds.  Ten seconds.  But no commotion, no shouting.  He frowns.
Mcclane: Where's the fucking cavalry? 152-A   INT. LOBBY - SAME TIME                                152-A Powell walks casually across the slick floor, eyes panning the area.  Eddie sits casually watching a game on one of his monitor screens.
Eddie: We already had that false alarm, you ask me, the Goddamn computers sent you out on another wild goose chase. They been chasing bugs in that system since they installed it.
Mcclane: Come on, come on...who's in that car, Stevie Wonder? He makes up his mind.  He lifts one of the big chairs and swings it at the window.  The tempered glass whitens on the first blow. 153-B   EXT. ROOF                                            153-B James sees the glass whiten below him and shouts into his mike. 153-C   INT. MACHINE FLOOR                                   153-C Heinrich hears the radio and shouts to Marco who grabs his machine gun and runs. 154     INT. LOBBY                                           154 Eddie watches confidently as Powell moves through the lobby looking for signs of trouble. 154-A   AROUND THE CORNER FROM POWELL                        154-A Uli is there, gun held ready.                                 * 155     BOARD ROOM - 34th FLOOR                              155 McClane draws the chair back for the final hit when a terrorist (MARCO) appears at the door.  Both men react, but Marco already has his gun up.  He FIRES a round at McClane.  The bullets rip into the table top and the chair, and McClane goes down behind the table. 156-    OUT                                             OUT  156- 156-A                                                        156-A 157     INT. 34th FLOOR - BOARD ROOM                         157 Marco smiles and moves around to the other side of the table, but finds no one.  He looks around frantically than squats beneath the table and sees: 158     MCCLANE                                              158 lying prone, his pistol trained on him.
Mcclane: Drop it or you're a rugstain. 159     BOARD ROOM DOORWAY                                   159 Just then Heinrich, the terrorist steps into the doorway, sees the situation.
Heinrich: Marco, duck! Marco dives sideways, but Heinrich still isn't quick enough. McClane FIRES TWICE and Heinrich DROPS sprawling in the hallway, machine gun FIRING BLINDLY until he hits the floor. 159-A   HOSTAGE FLOOR                                         159-A They can FAINTLY HEAR the gunshots.  Holly pales: 159-B   THE LOBBY                                             159-B All Powell can hear here is "LET IT SNOW, LET IT SNOW."  He STOPS just a yard from seeing the armed terrorist, turns back.
Powell: Screw this. He turns back. 159-C   THE BOARD ROOM                                        159-C Marco springs on top of the huge table.  McClane rolls on his back so he can cover either angle but it is clear that Marco is in the more enviable position. 160     ON MARCO                                              160 on the table top slams in a fresh magazine and smiles.
Marco: Next time -- don't hesitate. He leans his machine gun over the edge. 161     MCCLANE                                               161 aims directly above him and fires twice into the underside of the table.  The bullets rip through the table and Marco, who DROPS beside McClane.
Mcclane: Thanks for the advice. 162     OUT                                             OUT   162 163     INT. LOBBY - SAME                                     163 Powell heads for the door.  Eddie moves to lock up after him.
Powell: Sorry to water your time.  Merry Christmas. Powell goes out. 164     INT. 34TH FLOOR BOARD ROOM - SAME                     164 McClane rolls out from under the table, goes to the windows, and looks down in time to see Powell heading for the car.
Mcclane: Oh, man, please, no -- Desperate, he leans on the glass...which CRACKS again, on the verge of going.  McClane thinks...looks over his shoulder at the body of Marco. 165     INT. POWELL'S POLICE CAR - SAME                       165 Powell check in on his radio.  Unconsciously he begins to HUM the Muzak he overheard in the lobby.
Powell: One Adam Ten to 6421.  We had a wild goose chase on that 436. Everything's okay here.  Over. (waiting, loosening his tie, he murmurs) 'Oh, the weather outside is frightful, but the...the uh, dum, de dum's delightful...'
Dispatcher'S Voice: Roger, One Adam Ten.  We thought it was a crank call anyway.  Clear to code eight.
Powell: Roger. (putting the car into gear) '...let is snow, let it snow, let it snow -- ' Suddenly Marco's body CRASHES onto the hood of his car.
Dispatcher'S Voice: Roger, One Adam Ten, please repeat. But Powell accelerates in reverse away from the building, keeping his head low and praying he doesn't hit anything as the bullets follow him, digging into asphalt.  A half block away his car runs off the pavement and down a SLOPE, finally BOUNCING to a jarring HALT in a parking lot which is destined to become police H.Q. a few pages from now.  Powell sits up and clutches the mike.
Powell: One Adam Ten, under automatic rifle fire at Nakatomi!  Requesting immediate backup and SWAT assistance... 166     INT. 34TH FLOOR - BOARD ROOM                          166     * McClane looks down at Powell and grins.
Mcclane: Welcome to the party, pal.
Powell'S Voice: (intermixed with all this) -- guys, you want to cut through the red tape?  They practically turned this car into Swiss cheese -- !
Thornburg: Mary, this is Dick.  I want a remote truck and a crew to meet me at the South gate in fifteen minutes...
Woman'S Voice: Richard?  Richard? 167     EXT. CENTURY CITY - NIGHT                            167 Sirens wail as the first few police cars arrive.  Powell sees them, waves them back, points to the third floor. 168     INT. HOSTAGE WING - ON ELLIS - SAME                  168 He leans back and closes his eyes, luxuriating in the sound of WAILING POLICE SIRENS.  He looks at Holly.
Ellis: I never through I'd love to hear that sound. 169     HANS' OFFICE                                         169 Hans, Karl, Fritz and Franco confer.
Intercut: 169-A   MCCLANE - 34th FLOOR - BOARD ROOM                    169-A    * He's got a CB on the table and ON, and his cop's notebook is out again.  He's already upgraded the NUMBER OF TERRORISTS? to "12 (?) minus 3 = 9" and added other information.  As he speaks he takes ammo clips the dead men dropped, their sidearms, etc.
Mcclane: Gee, I'm sorry, Hans, nobody gave me the message.  You shoulda put it on the bulletin board.  Anyway, I thought you and Franco and Karl and the other boys might be lonely, now that I waxed Tony and Marco and their buddy.  So I invited some of the guys from my card game. In the office, the terrorists REACT, startled, as McClane name-drops. FRANCO                                * How...how does he know so much about --
Hans: Who are you, then?
Mcclane: Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass - McClane STOPS in mid-speech.  He's just opened the kit bag Heinrich had over his shoulder when he died.  Now McClane takes out the contents...dozens and dozens of EXPLOSIVE DETONATORS marked "DANGER" and a CHUNK of cello-wrapped PLASTIQUE the size of an electric razor.  He WHISTLES in surprise to himself. In the office, Hans turns off his mike for a moment, turns to Karl.                                                      *
Hans: Check on all the others...don't use the radio.  See if he's lying about Marco  and find out if anyone                  * else is missing.                                     * He moves.   Hans goes back onto the CB.  Meanwhile, McClane   * SMILES at the tell-tale STATIC as Hans goes off and on.  He knows what's happening.  Now, he starts to walk down a corridor, eyes PANNING FROM elevator to the stairwell doors.
Hans: Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
Mcclane: I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Hans: I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?
Mcclane: Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
Hans: He had the detonators!
Intercut: 171-A   THEO - IN SAFE ROOM                                   171-A With Kristoff, he has DRILLED TWO HOLES in the safe and is working on a third when he HEARS the CB.  He turns off the drill, answers.
Theo: Yo!
Hans: We may have some problems.  How is your schedule? Theo moves to his computer screen which shows a schematic of the safe and blinking icons and the words MECHANICALS #2 and #2 DISABLED.
Theo: Three down, four to go --
Hans: Then don't waste time talking to me. Suddenly all REACT to a nearby CB transmitter which broadcasts.
Powell'S Voice: This is Sergeant Al Powell of the Los Angeles Police Department.  If the person who radioed for help on this channel can hear me, acknowledge this transmission...I say again... 172     INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE - NIGHT                  172     *
Intercut: 173     EXT. POLICE OPERATIONS TRAILER                        173 Powell stands in front of his destroyed cruiser and looks up at the building.  Behind him technicians, City Power and Light personnel, SWAT officers in protective gear, etc., arrive from all directions.  A trailer is being backed into a parking lot, which will become the police center of operations.  It is like watching a small town being constructed right before your eyes.
Intercut: 173-A   HANS AND KARL                                         173-A Listening intently.
Mcclane: Maybe later.  Just listen fast because this is a party line and the neighbors are trigger happy. Now here's the skinny:  There's thirty or so hostages on the 30th floor, with probably 2 or 3 guards to cover a group that size. The leader here is named Hans, and besides the pea shooter he ventilated your car with,                            * they got machine guns and                            * sidearms up the yin yang.  On top of that one of 'em had a big enough chunck of plastic explosive to orbit Kate Smith.                                    * NOTE:  The following dialogue is said OVER McClane's.
Franco: We have to find him and shut him up!  He's telling them everything --
Hans: (shaking his head, calming) The police are irrelevant.  We've                    * waiting for the FBI.  Until they                     * arrive, we can't finish out work. Meanwhile, let this fool waste time for the police.  Fritz, go help Uli                  * find the bag. The CAMERA TIGHTENS ON him
Hans: We must find those detonators. They leave. 173-B   WITH MCCLANE                                          173-B
Powell'S Voice: How many are there?
Powell: How do you know?
Mcclane: I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay. We notice that everything McClane has said about "clothing" and ID's and police jargon, etc., has set off a little buzzer in Powell's brain.
Powell: I hear you...
Mcclane: I'm ahead of you...partner.
Powell: Uh, what do I call you? A moment.  McClane smiles.  What the hell?
Mcclane: 'Roy'.
Powell: Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Robinson: Who's talking to them? Powell turns around
Powell: I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
Robinson: Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
Powell: The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Powell: We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
Powell: I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
Robinson: How do you know?
Powell: A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony
Robinson: Oh shit... 179     HOSTAGE FLOOR                                         179 Hans examines building plans at Holly's desk.  Behind him the TV is ON, the sound muted.  TV cops triumph over oafish bad guys. Hans looks up as Fritz brings in Holly.
Holly: I...have a request.
Hans: Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Hans: Go on.
Holly: We have a pregnant woman out there --
Hans: No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Holly: Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
Hans: Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Holly: Gennero.  Miss Gennero. He nods, thoughtful.  She goes out.  Hans suddenly notices: 180     CLOSER - TV                                          180 A slide "SPECIAL BULLETIN" has appeared.  This changes to a SHOT of the Nakatomi building with "LIVE" supered over it. Richard Thornburg is in front. The CAMERA TIGHTENS ON him.
Thornburg: This is Richard Thornburg, speaking to you live from Century City... where Los Angeles has joined the sad but world wide fraternity whose only membership requirement is the awesome spectre of International Terrorism... 181     ANOTHER TV SCREEN - NIGHT                            181 As Thornburg Continues, we PULL BACK.  We're WITH Argyle in the back seat of the limo.
Argyle: (reaching for the remote) What else is new...? The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we SEE the Nakatomi Building rise up in the b.g. behind Thornburg.
Thornburg: We're told that the situation began some two hours ago when an unidentified party of men took over the building and sealed off all of its entrances and exits... Argyle is already bailing out of the car. 182     EXT. LIMO - IN THE GARAGE                            182 Argyle looks at the metal gates, swallows.  He JUMPS back in the car. 183     BACK INSIDE                                          183 Argyle pours himself a stiff drink.
Powell: What's going on?
Robinson: What's it look like?  We're going in.
Robinson: -- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Powell: What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Robinson: Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
Mitchell: Chief, we're ready.
Robinson: I'm coming.
Mitchell: Begin your reconnoiter. 185     MCCLANE                                               185 Inside the building, sadly realizing that the Marlboro pack has only two more to go.  He savors the dregs of his current number, then suddenly becomes aware of an almost EERIE QUIET. He moves to the window. 186     HIS P.O.V. - OUTSIDE                                  186 Hints of activity in the darkness.  A LIGHT FLARES extinguished. Shadows move on trailer walls. 187     BACK TO SCENE                                         187
Intercut: 188     OUTSIDE                                               188 Powell stiffens.  Robinson looks at him warningly, shakes his head.
Powell: I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Mcclane: Al, what's wrong?  Did something --
Powell: I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray. Hating himself, Powell DISCONNECTS, watches LIGHTS snaps on in the parking lot to illuminate the area. Also hating himself, McClane does the same thing.  Pale, he moves to a window to watch what he knows is going to be brutal. 188-A   IN HOLLY'S OFFICE - HANS                              188-A He hunches over his communicator.
Hans: They'll be coming.  Get ready. Theo, watch the screens.  Be our eyes and ears.
Police Barricades: Mitchell listens to CB radio.
Robinson: They're going after the lights! The two SWAT officers cutting the garage ate suddenly look up as their cover starts to disappear.
Robinson: Call them back.
Mitchell: No, they're almost in. Suddenly the third and fourth lights are shot out and the SWAT men become sitting ducks. 196     IN HOLLY'S OFFICE - HANS                              196 He calmly speak into his CB.
Hans: Don't get impatient.  Just wound them. 197     INT. LOBBY                                            197 Eddie and Uli fire.  They hit one of the officers in the leg, the second one in the arm. 198     EXT. POLICE BARRICADES - ON MITCHELL AND ROBINSON     198
Theo: Well, what have we here.  The police've got themselves an R.V. James, Alexander, southeast corner. 201     INT. 3RD FLOOR - SAME                                 201 The service elevator arrives on the 3rd floor and James and Alexander move across the room toward the windows with the anti-tank weapon.  At the window, they prepare the weapon for use. Outside the window the armored car has stopped in front of the wounded man and paramedics quickly load them in from the sheltered side of the vehicle.  Alexander quickly sights on the armored car.
Hans: Hit it again. 204     MCCLANE                                               204 listening.  He picks up his CB.
Mcclane: Hans, you motherfucker, you've made your point.  Let them pull back!
Hans' Voice: Thank you Mr. Cowboy, I'll take it under advisement.  His it again. McClane slumps to the floor below the window.  He feels helpless, then notices his kit bag. 205     3RD FLOOR                                             205 James runs back to the crate on the elevator. 206     EXT. POLICE BARRICADE - ON ROBINSON AND MITCHELL      206 They look on in horror as the armored car sits helplessly on fire.  On the police radio channel we HEAR the screams of men inside.
Rivers: (voice over; on radio, yelling) This is Rivers.  We've got one dead. Everybody's hit.  Rodriguiz's bleeding bad.  We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Explosive - Same: Like a football.  It sits on the seat of a secretary's chair with castors.  We PULL BACK TO SEE McClane press three detonators into the top, then cover the explosive with a typewriter, tying it securely in place with electrical cords. 209     ANGLE ON SERVICE ELEVATOR - MCCLANE                   209 wheels the chair to the service elevator, opens the door and block them with a fire axe.  He looks in -- the top of the car can just be seen thirty-five floors below. 210     INT. 3RD FLOOR                                        210 James hands the shell to Alexander, who expertly loads it into the anti-tank gun. Alexaneder lifts the  gun to his shoulder and aims. 211     INT. 38TH FLOOR                                       211 McClane push the chair into the shaft.
Mcclane: Geronimo...motherfuckers. For a long moment there is nothing, then:  the shaft is filled with light, then SOUND -- an ungodly ROAR -- and McClane is thrown back across the elevator corridor against the other back of doors by the concussion wave. 212     ON THE 3RD FLOOR                                      212 The explosion, like a firestorm, rips across the floor: 213     BLOWING OUT THE MACHINE GUN NEXT AND JAMES AND        213
Alexander: 214     SHATTERING WINDOWS                                    214 215     SENDING DESKS, CHAIRS, PHONES, AND TYPEWRITERS        215
Flying: 216     EXT. AVENUE OF THE STARS                              216 The police take cover behind their cars.  Powell, Robinson, and Mitchell look like they've seen the face of God as the building rocks from the blast.  Henry's cigarette falls from his mouth as a desk is sent hurtling across Avenue of the Stars into the trees across the street. 217     INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - ON WILLIAM - SAME   217 watching it on TV, feeling it all around him.
William: Oh, Jesus... 218     EXT. DOWN ON THE STREET - SAME                        218 Dick Thornburg's crew is taping.
Cameraman: Yep. Thornburg looks at his competitors still setting up.
Thornburg: Eat your heart out, Channel Four. 219-    OUT                                             OUT   219- 221                                                           221 222     ON HOSTAGE FLOOR                                      222 The hostages are shaken and the terrorists guarding them aren't too sure of themselves either.  Only Hans is relatively calm.
Franco: They're using artillery on us -- !
Hans: You idiot, it's not the police...
Mcclane: Al!  Al, the guys in the car, did they make it?
Intercut: 225     EXT. POWELL                                          225 on the street, watching as the survivors are pulled out of the wreck and to safety.
Mcclane: The plastique I found.
Powell: No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors. (looking off, nodding) One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Mcclane: Two?  Are you sure? Before Powell can answer Robinson comes running up to him.
Robinson: Is that him?
Powell: Yessir.
Robinson: (reaching for Powell's CB) Give me that.
Mcclane: Glass, my ass!  Who the fuck is this?
Robinson: This is Deputy Chief of Police Dwayne T. Robinson, and I'm in charge of this situation. McClane leans tiredly against the elevator door.
Mcclane: Well, from up here, it looks like you're in charge of shit, Dwayne. I haven't seen such a fucked up operation since the Bride of Frankenstein.  Ask the guys in the armored car if they minded a little flying glass.
Robinson: Listen asshole -- !
Argyle: Tell 'em, Mr. Mac!  Tell 'em! 227     INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                         227 still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then:
Powell'S Voice: Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling?
Intercut: 228     ON POWELL                                            228 Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation.
Powell: Hey, I love you.
Gail: (as the picture stabilizes) ...of the Nakatomi building, sources say that the terrorist leader 'Hans' may be this man, Hans Gruber. A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns to the office.
Holly: Where are you going?
Ellis: I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband. (to the approaching Fritz) Hi there.
Ellis: Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.
Karl: (in mid-speech, angry) -- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
Hans: If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
Karl: I don't want neutral...I want dead -- ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there.
Ellis: Hope I'm not interrupting...?
Ellis: It's not what I want, it's what I can give you.  Look, let's be straight, okay?  It's obvious you're not some dumb thug up here to snatch a few purses, am I right? Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis.
Hans: You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
Ellis: Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.
Ellis: The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you. As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we:
Powell: Roy!  You all right? 232     INSIDE - MCCLANE                                     232 He's by an open desk drawer, having just ripped open a package of twinkies he's found.  He grimaces, mouth full.
Mcclane: Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
Powell: Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch? McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet, flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids in happier days.
Mcclane: Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
Powell: It's a date.  You buy the ice cream. McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another VOICE besides Powell's comes over his radio.
Intercut: 235     MCCLANE AND HANS                                     235
Hans' Voice: I have someone who wants to talk to you.  A very special friend who was at the party with you tonight. McClane's face falls.  Oh, God.  Eyes closed, he waits for the voice that tells him it's all over.
Ellis' Voice: Hello, John boy? McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope. In the office, CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW Ellis as Hans gives him the CB.
Mcclane: Ellis? Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke.
Ellis: John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
Ellis: I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party. McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his eyes.
Mcclane: Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
Ellis: Tell me about it. He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.
Ellis: All right...John, listen to me... They want you to tell them where the detonators are.  They know people are listening.  They want the detonators of they're going to kill me. Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it. 236     INT. POLICE TRAILER - ON POWELL, ROBINSON - SAME     236 and others listening intently.  McClane closes his eyes and leans his head back again.  He knows what is going to happen, even if this poor bastard Ellis doesn't.
Ellis' Voice: John, didn't you hear me?
Ellis: John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
Mcclane: Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
Hans: Good.  Then you'll give us what we want and save your friend's life. You're not part of this equation. It's time to realize that. Saying this, Hans takes out his gun, points it at Ellis, smiling. Ellis smiles, too.
Ellis: What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
Mcclane: That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --
Ellis: John, how can you say that, after all these years--?  John?  John? Ellis looks at Hans and shrugs, "Well, I tried..." Hans nods understandingly.  He takes the CB, presses the TALK button, and in one frighteningly smooth motion brings the Walther up to Ellis' forehead and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
Hans: Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...
Robinson: Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
Powell: Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
Robinson: Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Powell: No Sir.  You couldn't drag me away.
Intercut: 241     HANS' OFFICE                                         241
Hans: This is Hans Gruber.  I assume you realize the futility of direct action against me.  We have no wish for further loss of life.
Robinson: What do you wish for, Mister Gruber?
Hans: I have comrades in arms around the world who are languishing in prison. The American State Department enjoys rattling its saber to its own ends... now it can rattle it for me.
Intercut: 242     MCCLANE                                              242 Listening to this with expressions ranging from astonishment to dismay to outright derisive amusement.
Hans' Voice: ...The following people are to be released from their captors:  In Northern Ireland, the seven members of the New Provo Front.  In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders of Liberte de Quebec... 243     HANS' OFFICE                                         243
Hans: ...in Sri Lanka, the nine members of the Asian Dawn movement...
Robinson: Two hours?  Are you insane?  I can't authorize...hello?  Hello?
Karl: Do you think they'll even try to do it?
Hans: Who cares? (on another channel) Theo.  Are we on schedule?
Intercut: 244     VAULT ROOM                                           244 Theo and Kristoff have been rewarded with another LOCK
Deactivated.: THEO                                  * One more to go...then it's up to you. The graphic on his screen flashes:  "WARNING:  ELECTRO-       * MAGNETIC SEAL ARMED."                                         *
Theo: And you better be right, because this one's going to take a miracle. HANS                                  * It's Christmas, Theo, it's the time of miracles.  So be of good cheer and call me when you hit the last lock.
Karl: Franco is checking the explosives, Fritz is with him.
Hans: I'll check the explosives.  You just get those detonators. 245     MCCLANE - 32ND FLOOR                                 245 As he talks, he essentially PATROLS the floor he's staked out, constantly looking into every dark corner, gun held ready, moving toward the stairwell.
Mcclane: Al?  Al, you there?
Powell: I'm here, cowboy.
Mcclane: Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Powell: Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Mcclane: The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Powell: In my youth, partner.  In my youth. 246     INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT                               246 Gail and Harvey have company, a man from the Senator Paul Simon's school of grooming.
Hasseldorf: Well, Gail, by this time the hostages and their captors should be entering the early stages of the Helsinki Syndrome.
Harvey: As in Helsinki, Sweden? 247     CONTROL ROOM                                          247 Sam sighs, shakes his head.
Robinson: The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?
Young Cop: Yessir.  Right over there. Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.
Robinson: (stepping forward, plastic smile) Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
Big Johnson: Not any more. As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO: 257     THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                   257 He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the floor. 258     LOW ANGLE                                              258 He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET. A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.
Mcclane: Lost? 259     NEW ANGLE                                              259 A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up. The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind- boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows, looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:
Hans: --ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
Hans: A way up to the roof...I thought I could signal for help -- He starts in that direction.
Mcclane: Forget it.  They got a guy up there. You want to stay alive, keep moving. Hey?  You hear me? Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.
Hans: You...you're an American?
Mcclane: (friendly, easing the man's fears) Only if New Jersey counts. It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.
Big Johnson: Thank you.  We'll handle it from here.  When we need to commandeer your men, we'll try and let you know. He starts to move away with his partner.
Big Johnson: Such as...?
Little Johnson: He's inside?  Who is he?
Big Johnson: One of yours?
Mcclane: Relax, man...you smoke? Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.
Hans: You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
Mcclane: I'm a cop from New York.
Mcclane: Better than being caught with your pants down, right?
Mcclane: Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
Mcclane: Sounds better than nothing. McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in a fresh one and hands it to him.
Mcclane: Time for the real thing. McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a CLICK.  He slowly turns: 265-A   NEW ANGLE                                              265-A Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into his radio in German.
Hans: Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come quickly.
Mcclane: Hans.  Your Hans.
Hans: (nods, indicating McClane's gun again) Put it down now.
Mcclane: That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
Hans: I'm going to count to three...
Trigger.: Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in carefully, reclaims his pistol.
Mcclane: You think I'm a shmuch, Hans. Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.
Hans: You were saying. McClane whirls in time to see: 266-    OUT                                           OUT    266- 269                                                          269 260     KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ                               270 Coming out of it, FIRING. 271     BACK TO SCENE                                        271 McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back at: 272     WHERE HANS WAS                                       272 He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his passing. 273     BACK TO SCENE                                        273 McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a: 273-A-  OUT                                            OUT   273-A- 273-I                                                        273-I 274     BANK OF COMPUTERS                                    274 Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at: 275     FRANCO                                               275 McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his weapon FLYING: 276     CLOSER                                               276 He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head. Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up: 277     MCCLANE                                              277 hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction. He turns: 278     HANS                                                 278 has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon. 279     MCCLANE                                              279 FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans, who escapes with only superficial scratches. 280     HANS                                                 280 looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to Karl in German:
Hans: The glass!  Shoot the glass! And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit. 281     MCCLANE                                              281 as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it. BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor: 282     HIS FOOT                                             282 goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going: 283     STAIRWELL DOOR                                       283 He's out, gone, safe! 284     BACK TO SCENE                                        284 Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through rubble, then comes over, smiling. He's holding the bag of detonators.
Hans: Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.
Thornburg: You got something?
Ginny: That one look pissed, Ms. Gennero...
Theo: You better heat up that miracle                      * you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
Intercut: 290     HANS' OFFICE                                          290
Hans: (unphased)                                    * Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up. 291     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                 291 Wincing in pain, McClane washes his foot in a sink basin.  He washes a deep cut, soaps it, but the pain doesn't relent. When a VOICE speaks, he JUMPS, realizes it's the CB.
Mcclane: Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
Intercut: 292     POWELL - OUTSIDE                                      292
Powell: They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you. McClane tries to wrap paper towels on the foot but his grimace shows that is still hurts like hell.
Powell: You don't want to know. Suddenly remembering an NYPD course in first aid from ten years ago, McClane removes the improvised bandage, check the cut more carefully.
Powell'S Voice: I...realized I couldn't do what I had to anymore...at least not out there.  I had an...accident. McClane throws the glass across the room, forehead bathed in sweat.
Mcclane: I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Mcclane: I still feel like shit.
Powell: Then this won't matter.
Hans: That's the FBI...ordering them to cut                * the building's power.  They're as regular as clockwork...or a time lock... ON Theo's look:
Hans: ...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Theo: When you're hot, you're hot.
Guy In Manhole: We're spliced in down the line.
Little Johnson: Do it...now. The engineer THROWS GIANT LEVERS.  Inside the manhole, SPARKS SIZZLE and massive contacts CLUNK. 295     THE BUILDING                                          295 One by one, all the light on all the floors GO OUT. 296     MCCLANE                                               296 in the bathroom, ripping off his shirt and tying it around his foot, he REACTS --
Intercut: 297     OUTSIDE                                               297
Kristoff: Damn!  It didn't go!
Theo: They're on the building circuit... it's too local.
Hans: Encourage them to be bolder.
Theo: The only thing left for them is the City Grid...
Little Johnson: Shit! (turning, to the Engineer) Cut it again.  Go wider.
Engineer: I can't go wider here... (to Robinson, looking for help) ...I'd have to call downtown have them take down one of the city grids...you're talking ten square block --
Robinson: -- ten blocks?
Big Johnson: (ignoring Robinson, to the Engineer) We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
Engineer: I need authorization --
Big Johnson: Authorization?  How about the United States Fucking Government? Lose the grid or lose your job! The engineer looks at Robinson.  No help.  The engineer looks at his guy in the manhole, shrugs.  No choice.
Out Again.: 303     IN THE VAULT ROOM                                     303 EMERGENCY LIGHTING FLICKS ON.   An ALARM "beep-beep-beeps." 304     THE LED READOUT ON THE SAFE                           304 changes to "FIBER OPTIC TIME LOCK DEACTIVATED AT SOURCE. SEVENTH LOCK DISENGAGED." 305     BACK TO SCENE                                         305 With a dramatic HUM worthy of 2001, the vault door OPENS! 306     OUTSIDE                                               306 The FBI guys look at the dark building, than at the LAPD guys.
Big Johnson: That should shake'em up.  With all the power shut down, those bastards are probably scared shitless. 307     IN THE VAULT ROOM                                     307 The safe door finishes its ponderous move, CLUNKS to a halt. Theo and Kristoff LAUGH, give each other high fives.  Even Hans loses his usual cool, slaps Theo on the back as Theo and Kristoff CHEER.
Intercut: 310     VAULT ROOM                                            310 Hans talks while Theo and Kristoff tackle the problem of unloading the racks and racks of bonds and transferring them to the black cases.
Hans: This is Hans...
Big Johnson: This is Agent Johnson of the FBI. The State Department has arranged for the release of your comrades.  The helicopters you requested are on the way.
Hans: I hear you, FBI.  We'll be ready. He disconnects, smiles at Theo.
Hans: When they touch down and we blow the roof, they'll spend a month sifting through the bodies and rubble.  By the time they figure out what went wrong... (smiling at the irony) ...we'll be earning twenty percent like nice fat Capitalists.
Mcclane'S Voice: Powell, listen... Powell moves off to be alone.
Intercut: 311     INT. BATHROOM                                         311
Powell: I'm here, John. McClane tries walking on his foot.  He winces in pain, clearly at the end of his resources.
Mcclane: I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs. (pause; struck by a thought) Upstairs...
Powell: Roy?
Mcclane: Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out. He moves towards the door, limping hurriedly out of the room.
Paulina: I'm sorry...Mrs. Holly says I couldn't let strangers into --
Thornburg: Strangers?  I'm with KFLW TV, that's affiliated with the FCC, and I'm sure you know that's the United States government...just like the INS? As she wavers...
Mcclane: I was here...he was... His eyes flick over the area...then he looks up.  Seeing something, he moves closer.  He sets down his CB and then, with difficulty, he climbs up on a thick pipe, flicks his lighter and hold its high. 314     HIS P.O.V.                                            314 Explosives are everywhere. 315     BACK TO SCENE                                         315 He reacts, quickly extinguishing the lighter.  He follows the detonator lines with his eyes.
Mcclane: Oh my God... He drops to the floor, winces in pain, picks up his CB.
Mcclane: Powell!  Powell, listen to me!  You're being double crossed!  The whole roof of this building is -- Suddenly a GUN BARREL is pressed against his head.  He stiffens. 316     NEW ANGLE                                             316 Karl takes his Baretta, tosses it away.  Then Karl takes the CB.  Smiling, Karl SMASHES the transmitter underfoot.
Officer: I did.  He said something about a, a double cross...
Eddie: They're coming. CAMERA PANS across the room to the doorway of the office, where Hans nods, stands.
Thornburg'S Voice From Tv: -- I know you're proud of your daddy... 322     CLOSEUP - HOLLY                                       322 She's speechless, watching in shock as: 323     THE PORTABLE TV                                       323 shows Thornburg at Holly's house!  He's squatting down with his microphone to interview the children in their P.J.s.  His voice is soft, comforting.
Lucy: Come home. 324     HOLLY                                                 324 She struggles to stay composed...can't.  She slowly turns her head, looks at Hans. 325     HER P.O.V. - HANS                                     325 He's looking away from us, at the picture of the children on her desk.  He turns back and looks at her.  He smiles.
Hans: Mrs. McClane.  How nice to make your acquaintance. He raises his weapon...but he only shoot it into the ceiling, making everyone jump!
Mcclane: Better this way, isn't it?  I mean, any faggot can shoot a gun. This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he does charge, it's unexpected. The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street. 327     NEW ANGLE                                             327
Mcclane: You should've heard your brother scream when I broke his fucking neck... Karl steps in quickly with a deadly move.  McClane twists free, slams an elbow into Karl's kidney.  Karl backs off, circles McClane with new respect.
Little Johnson: (shouting over the noise of the rotors) What do you figure on breakage?
Big Johnson: I figure we take out all the terrorists, and lose 20 percent of the hostages... 25, tops.
Little Johnson: I can live with those numbers.
Hans: A little bonus for us. (shoving her forward violently) A policeman's wife might come in handy. He picks up a CB, speaks into it.
Hans: McClane!  McClane!  I have some news for you...McClane? 330     THE MACHINE FLOOR                                     330 TILT UP from the CB radio Karl smashed. Karl and McClane are in the b.g., almost toe to toe, all their tricks played out, going at it with animal instinct. 331     THE VAULT ROOM                                        331
Hans: McClane? (pause, then on a new channel) Karl?  Karl? Nothing.  He looks at Theo.
Hans: Hurry. 332     THE ROOF                                              332 Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last few out. 333     LONG SHOT - FBI CHOPPERS - DOWN AVE. OF THE STARS     333 They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash shaking the trees. 334     POWELL AND ROBINSON                                   334 Following them with their eyes, for once sharing the same opinion. 335     HOSTAGES ON THE ROOF                                  335 They see their very own Christmas decorations, the friendly copter lights, and begin to smile and cheer.  Uli smiles to himself, moves towards the door: 336     VAULT ROOM                                            336 Theo closes the lid of a bond-stuffed case, carries it out of the room.  Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others continue.
Hans: I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite. He SLAPS her. 337     MACHINE FLOOR                                         337 Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another one. McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs upwards, propelling Karl into the air: 338     LOW ANGLE                                             338 Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes entangled. 339     MCCLANE                                               339 jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain. 340     KARL                                                  340 is JERKED upwards by the neck.  He TWITCHES like a captured fish -- starts to turn blue: 341     MCCLANE                                               341 Twists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.  McClane snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out.
Big Johnson: Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?
Pilot: My kind of town.
Mcclane: Where's Holly --
Ginny: The took her -- after they saw the kids on television --
Mcclane: What?  God -- He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS.
Mcclane: Listen to me!  All of you, get down to the lower floors -- you're all in danger.
Hostage: What are you, crazy?  We're being rescued!  Those helicopters --
Mcclane: -- there won't be shit for those helicopters to land on, because the whole top of this building is wired with explosives!  Now get below --
Second Hostage: But...we're safe up here --
Mcclane: Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad, it's a launching pad! And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof. They really haul ass.
Mcclane: GET BELOW!  NOW! 344     IN THE WING CHOPPER - MID-AIR                         344 A YOUNG FBI AGENT is here with a rifle and a partner.
Young Fbi: (into throat mike, looking out the door) Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think they're on to us.  One of the terrorists is firing on the hostages. 345     INSIDE THE OTHER CHOPPER                              345
Big Johnson: Bank and we'll nail him! 351     THE VAULT ROOM                                        351 Hans whirls towards Kristoff.
Hans: Blow the roof.  Now!
Kristoff: But Karl and Uli are up there -- CAMERA ADJUSTS to show the remote detonator on a table.  Hans goes to it. 352     THE ROOF                                              352 McClane DIVES away from another burst.
Mcclane: You assholes, I'm on your side -- ! They come in on another pass.  Desperate, he looks around, see a fire hose.  Makes up his mind.  With the chopper LOOMING UP behind him, he slings Uli's weapon, runs to the fire hose, unreels three yards, loops it around his back and under his legs. He looks over the edge, hesitates:
Mcclane: Fuck this... Bullets HIT all around him.  He JUMPS: 353     THE VAULT ROOM                                        353 Hans extends the antenna...HITS the button. 354     LONG SHOT - THE ROOF                                  354 The helipad EXPLODES!  A FIREBALL rolls into the sky. 355     THE HOSTAGES                                          355 lose their footing on the floor.  Dust and debris fall down, but they're okay. 356     JOHNSON AND JOHNSON'S CHOPPER                         356 STRAINS to avoid the rising fireball...can't!  It's CAUGHT in the explosion!  It tips over, a rotor hits the roof -- it CRASHES, EXPLODES, tumbles down the side of the building! 357     MCCLANE                                               357 Dangling against the side of the building, he DUCKS and winces as FLAMING DEBRIS soar past him. 358     THE ROOF - HOSE WHEEL DEVICE                          358 Flame ROARS TOWARDS it, engulfs it.  It JERKS on its foundation PIVOTS 180 degrees as several bolts slip: 359     MCCLANE                                               359 DROPS several more feet.  He swallows, then KICKS against the side of the building, his bloody feet leaving smears.  The shatterproof glass doesn't budge!  Wincing as more FLAMING DEBRIS sizzles by, McClane levels the machine gun, KICKS off from the building, SWINGS back ten feet -- reaches the zenith of his arc -- FIRES the gun and sails back in: 360     INSIDE THE BUILDING                                   360 McClane SMASHES through the shattered glass, SAILS inside, rolls onto the floor, PLOWING through furniture and decor.  Finally he STOPS, catches his breath with relief...rises to one knee: 361     UP ON THE ROOF                                        361 The fire hose mounting is BLASTED off the roof, SAILS past the
Camera: 362     OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                  362 The hose mechanism tumbles downward! 363     INSIDE                                                363 McClane is YANKED off his feet, dragged towards the window! 364     THE HOSE WHEEL - OUTSIDE                              364 It SLIDES down the side of the building!  The hose PLAYS OUT on the edge of the windowsill, dragging McClane towards his death! 365     MCCLANE                                               365 CLAWS at the floor...no help.  Inches from the shattered window, he braces his legs against the sill, groans as he fights the weight of the hose and the reel.  One foot SLIPS.  Only his already wounded foot keeps him indoors. He scrambles to untie his improvised rappeling rig -- gets free just before the hose nozzle CRASHES out and into the great beyond! Winded, strength ebbing, he staggers to his feet -- just in time for: 366     THE ROOF                                              366 to RECOIL from another staggering explosion! 367     THE HOSTAGES                                          367 They scream, cry out: 368     IN THE VAULT ROOM                                     368 As Holly covers her head from falling plaster, the men work like automatons, piling up the bonds. 369     MCCLANE                                               369 recovers from another AFTERSHOCK, runs up the steps -- is momentarily amazed to HEAR a "ding" from the elevator -- he looks at: 370     THE SHAFT                                             370 where suddenly the WALL EXPLODES OUTWARD as an ENTIRE ELEVATOR CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL, swinging on its cable like a demolition ball on a crane! 371     BACK TO SCENE                                         371 McClane runs up the steps as brickwork flies past his head like schrapnel: 372     THE ELEVATOR                                          372 reaches the apex of its swing, drops down in an arcing turn: 373     WIDE SHOT                                             373 the elevator CRASHES into the stairs!  The section McClane in on SNAPS LOOSE!  At the last minute McClane LEAPS towards: 374     THE VAULT FLOOR BALCONY                               374 and catches it as stairs and elevator CRUMBLE behind and beneath him!  With his last effort, he hauls himself onto the balcony and them moves off!
Hans: Let's move. The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a rifle butt. 385     WIDER                                                 385 McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun ready.
Mcclane: Hans! Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into view.  No words need be said.
Holly: John!
Mcclane: Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.
Mcclane: That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
Hans: No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
Mcclane: (slowly putting down his gun) Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
Hans: 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked. He aims:
Mcclane: Holly, now...! Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face! 386     MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                          386 At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS Hans high in the chest! The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is happening, McClane SPINS: 387     EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS             387 Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke. 388     BACK TO SCENE                                         388 Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood in shock. 389     MCCLANE                                               389
Mcclane: You were right about us Americans. (he blows smoke from his pistol barrel) We are cowboys. 390     VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                    390 Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS: 391     HOLLY'S WRIST                                         391 and she is YANKED off her feet! 392     BACK TO SCENE                                         392 Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the last minute! 393     EXT. BUILDING - LONG SHOT                             393 The roof still in flames, McClane hangs halfway out of the window, jagged glass raking his face, straining to hold onto Holly as Hans drags her out! McClane braces himself against the window frame and strains to pull Holly closer.  With a MOAN, she catches the windowsill with her inside hand.  McClane STRETCHES with his other hand, begins to INCH towards Holly's wristband. 394     HANS' HAND - WIDEN                                    394 A death grip on the watchband.  We WIDEN, SEE that, blood flecked teeth GRITTING, he is STRAINING with his other hand to bring up the gun he is still holding! 395     MCCLANE                                               395 Holly's SCREAM alerts him.  Hans locks eyes with McClane one last time, starts to pull the trigger, as: 396     VERY CLOSE                                            396 McClane RELEASES the latch on the watchband!  The overtaxed metal SNAPS, links flying: 397     WIDER                                                 397 Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch suddenly drop. We LISTEN to his scream all the way down, finally HEAR him HIT. McClane pulls Holly back into the room and holds her.
Mcclane: It's okay, babe.  It's okay. He looks down at Hans' body, then back at the scrap of wristband he's still holding.
Mcclane: You got a warranty on this? She laughs through her tears, holds onto him.
Powell: Bullshit.
Mcclane: I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
Holly: (taking Powell's hand, correcting) Holly McClane. Hearing this, McClane grins, pulls her close.                 *
Powell: You know, about him being such a jerk -- and how he's really sor --
Robinson: I want you for debrief, McClane. You've got some things to answer for -- Ellis' murder -- property damage -- interfering with police                    * business -- A SCREAM causes McClane to turn. 400     HIS P.O.V.                                            400 There in the doorway is Karl, clothing and body scorched. Easily as crusted in dirt and blood as McClane, he holds his machine gun. 401     EXT. BUILDING                                         401 As the crowd panics trying to escape, Karl locks eyes with McClane and levels his gun.  McClane throws Holly to the ground and grabs the dumbstruck Robinson's sidearm. But he doesn't get off a shot -- a lone gunshot stops Karl -- knocking him back through the doorway.  McClane looks back to see Powell still sighting down the barrel of his .38. His hand is rock steady.  He sees McClane's look.
Thornburg: Mr. McClane...Mrs. McClane...any comment on your incredible ordeal? What are your feelings now that it's all over? Without a beat, Holly PUNCHES HIM in the chops.  He FALLS, dropping the mike with an electronic SQUEAL.  McClane looks at his wife, amazed.  Behind them, Thornburg sits on the ground, * nurses his lip, turns to his camerman.
Thornburg: (eager)                                       * Did you get that? McClane and Holly continue on, turn towards:                  * 402     ARGYLE'S LIMO                                         402 It's a little smashed up, but still running.  Argyle is standing beside the open door.  McClane and Holly get in and Argyle closes the door.
Argyle: (getting in the front) If this is their idea of Christmas I gotta be there for New Year's. CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW the read window where McClane and Holly are kissing.  As they drive off, we:
