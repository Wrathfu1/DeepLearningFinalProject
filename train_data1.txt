Joe Shaye: Secret Service? What are you talking about? Keep your hands in the air.
Frank: You think the FBI are the only ones tracking this guy. We've been following a paper trail for months, almost had him in New York. Would you mind taking that gun out of my face, it makes me nervous.
Joe Shaye: Let me see some identification.
Frank: Here. Take my whole wallet. Frank throws his wallet to Joe, who catches it with his free hand, but doesn't open it. FRANK (CONT'D) You want my gun, too? Come over here and take my gun!

Joe Shaye: Not really. I made a mistake.
Special Agent Wilkes: Forget about it. There are hundreds of John Doe's out there.
Joe Shaye: Yeah, but I'm gonna get this one. The worst thi a paperhanger can do is show is I saw him, I heard his voice -- r s nothing for him
Spect-Aloa T Wilkes: Just be careful, J u've got 12- years in, nobody bo r u down on the first floor. You ally wrote the book on bank d, and that's good enough to make you F-4 { some day. There's no reason to put yourself in this type of position.
Joe Shaye: what position is that?
Special Agent Wilkes: The position of being humiliated. Joe stares at Wilkes, slowly stands and heads for the door. He's about to leave when he turns and looks back at Wilkes.

Frank: Okay. I'm at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan. Suite 3113. Joe starts to write this down, then suddenly stops himself.
Joe Shaye: You think you're gonna get me again, don't you? You'd love for me to send twenty agents out on Christmas Eve to barge into that hotel, break down doors so you can make a fool out of me again?
Frank: Joe, I'm sorry if I made a fool out of you.
J Shays: Goddamn it, o t you feel sorry for me. The tru h knew it was you. Maybe I didn 1 {he trigger, but I knew.
Frank: People only know wh r,y` iV tell them.

Frank: I have to go. I'm catching a flight in two hours. Merry Christmas, Joe.
Joe Shaye: You didn't call to apologize, did you John Doe?

Special Agent Wilkes: Wait a second, Joe. Those slips don't even have his name on them.
Joe Shaye: The bank scanners read the micker ink before they read pen ink. So even though those deposit slips are filled out correctly, each person who made a deposit that day was actually putting money into his account.
Special Agent Wilkes: How much did he get?
Joe Shaye: Forty-six thousand, four hundred and' twelve dollars. It was the second largest bank robbery in the history of Las Vegas. 98 INT. - PAN AM BUILDING COMMISSARY. - DAY 98 Paul Mulligan sits across from Frank eating lunch. Frank is dressed in school clothes and holding a notebook.

Joe Shaye: The Skywayman. Holy shit, a perfect match.
Amdursky: They describe The Skywayman as a thirty-year-old -- dark hair --six- feet -- same fucking guy!
Joe Shaye: It doesn't make any sense. A thirty- year-old has to register for the draft, which means his prints have to be here.
Fox: Maybe there's a reason he didn't register. He could have a wooden leg for all we know. Maybe he was born in Peru and he's not an American
Joe Shaye: Maybe he's not thirty.

Paula: He's forging checks? That's why you're here?
Joe Shaye: What he's doing is a federal offense. PAULA (CONT'D) A young boy has to eat, has to have a place to sleep. What do you want him to do? His father can't help him. Paula gets off the couch and grabs her purse.

Frank: No. Nobody will fire you. I'll bet you're good at your job.
Brenda: No, I'm not.
Frank: I'll bet if I asked you to check the status of my friend, Lance Applebaum, you could do that in a second. He hurt his foot tonight. Brenda grabs a chart, starts to read it out loud.
Brenda: Mr. Applebaum fractured his ankle. Doctor Ashland is treating him in exam seven.
Frank: See that. No problem. Brenda smiles, covering her mouth.
Brenda: This is the emergency chart. See the blue star, that means the patient has been diagnosed. After he's treated, we put a red circle here.
